Baba is Us - a game where you “make the rules” as you play the game. Our game is heavily inspired by a preexisting game, “Baba Is You.” In our game, you control a character named Baba who completes levels by meeting some goal in each level. The rules of each level are represented by “word blocks” (e.g. “LAVA”, “IS”, “WIN”) that can be moved around by Baba to its advantage. This game also consists of a multiplayer functionality. This will allow another person (who will control a character called Yaga) to play along with a person by using the WASD keys while the other person uses the arrow keys to move Baba.
